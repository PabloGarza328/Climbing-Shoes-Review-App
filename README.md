## Overview
This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) web application that allows users to manage climbing shoe reviews, track orders, and explore web development topics. The app is designed to showcase my web development skills and highlights key functionalities such as CRUD operations, dynamic state management, and responsive design
